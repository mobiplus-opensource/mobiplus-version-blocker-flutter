# Contributing to Version Blocker

First time contributing to Version Blocker? Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and review [How To Open a Mobiplus Pull Request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request).

### Report a bug

* Open an issue on the formula's repository or on Homebrew/brew if it's not a formula-specific issue.

### Propose a feature

* Open an issue with a detailed description of your proposed feature, the motivation for it and alternatives considered. Please note we may close this issue or ask you to create a pull-request if this is not something we see as sufficiently high priority.

### Submiting your pull request

Create your pull request from a new branch
To make a new branch and submit it for review, create a GitHub pull request with the following steps:

1. Check out the master branch:
> git checkout master
2. Retrieve new changes to the master branch:
> git pull
3. Create a new branch from the latest master branch:
> git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME> origin/master
*Make your changes*
4. Upload your branch of new commits to your fork:
> git push --set-upstream <YOUR_USERNAME> <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
5. Create a pull request to request review and merging of the commits in your pushed branch. Explain why the change is needed and, if fixing a bug, how to reproduce the bug. Make sure you have done each step in the checklist that appears in your new PR.
Await feedback or a merge from Homebrew’s maintainers. We typically respond to all PRs within a couple days, but it may take up to a week, depending on the maintainers’ workload.
Thank you!

Thanks!
